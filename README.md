# Competitive Programming for #100DaysOfCode

This repository will contain all the codes written for various competitive programming problems.

## Problems

1. [Counting Rooms](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1192): solution [here](/counting-rooms.cpp), category: ```graphs```, ```bfs```, ```dfs```
2. [Labyrinth](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1193): solution [here](labyrinth.cpp), category: ```graphs```, ```bfs```, ```dfs```

## Compilation and Running Instructions:

I will be using C++ and Golang as per the language for solving problems with primary language as C++. And may use Python for some problems.

### **C++**

For template, click [here](https://gist.github.com/mehrankamal/e4809a531045caf5445770fc6311982f)

Note: This template is minimal, so update as per your need.

Compilation: ```g++ -DLOCAL --std=c++17 -o main <file_to_compile>.cpp```

The ```LOCAL``` flag is set for checking running time of code, and input and output are provided from ```inputf.txt``` and ```outputf.txt```

### **Golang**

For template, click [here](https://gist.github.com/mehrankamal/e4809a531045caf5445770fc6311982f)

Note: The template has just the general I/O buffer redirections.

Running: ```go run <file_to_run>.go```
